# Python_RemoteLogin

## Web Login and Button Automation

This project demonstrates how to use Python and Selenium to log into a specific website and automate button actions like starting and stopping a button at specific times.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3
- Selenium WebDriver library
- Appropriate WebDriver for your browser (ChromeDriver or GeckoDriver)

## Installation

1. Install Selenium:

```bash
pip install selenium
```

2. Download and install the appropriate WebDriver for your browser:

- [ChromeDriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads)
- [GeckoDriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases)

3. Follow the instructions in the previous answer to add the WebDriver to your system PATH.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/web-login-and-button-automation.git
```

2. Change the working directory to the cloned repository:
```bash
cd web-login-and-button-automation
```

## Usage

Modify the main.py script and replace the following variables with your own credentials and target URL:
```bash
url = "https://example.com/login"
username = "your_username"
password = "your_password"
```
# Update the element names and IDs according to the website you're targeting.

Run the script:
```bash
python main.py
```

The script will log into the specified website, and then start and stop the button at the specified times.
